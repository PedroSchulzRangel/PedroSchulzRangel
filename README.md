- I am a young professional from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, aspiring to start a career as a Software Developer in technology company or in companies with a strong technological foundation
  
- I love learning new technologies constantly, and as a result, I have over 2,000 hours of Full Stack Development training at Driven Education and at Gama Academy, both respected schools in Brazil
     
- I also have a solid academic background in Chemical Engineering from a top-tier university (PUC-Rio) and 160 hours of Business Management training at COPPEAD/UFRJ
  
-  My main interest is tackling challenging problems
  
-  From the moment I learned how to program in my first languages (C/C++, Matlab and VBA) at university, I applied my knowledge to solve a real problem during my internship at Mineral Technology Center of Rio de Janeiro (2019-2021).
  
- The problem was that a specific task (image processing and analysis) was taking too long (over 3 hours) to be performed within the project. I came up with the idea of creating algorithms in a Java based software (ImageJ) to automate the image processing steps. The result was that after using the algorithms I developed myself, the processing of several images took less than 20 minutes to be performed.
  
- After this experience, I knew I wanted to work with Software Development somehow, and I decided to invest in two long-period programming courses that are reference to the brazilian market
       
-  Are you interested in more details of my academic background? Please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-schulz-rangel/) or send an email to psrangel5002@hotmail.com. I will be pleased to answer your questions.
